bash-stdlib: A collection of useful bash library functions
==========================================================

This package provides general-purpose `bash` functions that I have
written.

Requirements
============

This package has mostly been tested with the current Emacs package on
*Debian Linux (Jessie) 8.2*. There many optional packages that support
individual functions, they are given by a convienient install command
are:

    sudo apt-get install autossh conkeror emacs24 git fail2ban ffmpeg imagemagick nmap gnome-terminal vlc xbindkeys xclip
